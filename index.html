        <h1>Hi There! Welcome to our fundraiser for &lt;Charity Name&gt;</h1>
        <!-- <p>Together, we can make a difference!</p> -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>If you're reading this, someone probably nominated you to play in our fundraiser game. Congrats!</h2>
            <p>Basically, this is like the ALS ice bucket challenge, except with no ice buckets (or ALS).</p>
            <p>Literally all you have to do is nominate the next person to play. That's it!</p>
            <p>Every time someone like you makes a nomination between &lt;date 1&gt; to &lt;date 2&gt;, &lt;company name&gt; donates &lt;$X&gt; to support &lt;charity name&gt; on their mission to &lt;charity cause&gt;.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>Here's How to Nominate the Next Player</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>You can only nominate the next player <em>if you were nominated to do so.</em>
                    <br>
                    The person who nominated you will have needed to let you know that they nominated you.</li>
                <li>Nominate the next player by texting the fundraiser organizer (<a href = https://x.com/Michael_Loftus3 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Loftus</a>) at +1 2484446170.
                    <br>
                    He will only need the phone number of your nominee. You can send him a message like this:
                    <br>
                    <b>I nominate phone number &lt;replace with your nominee's phone number&gt;</b></li>
                <li>If your nominee has already been nominated to play by someone else, you will need to choose another nominee.
                    <br>Michael will let you know if this is the case.</li>
                <li>Tell your nominee that you nominated them, and send them this webpage so they know how to play!</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>If you don't make the next nomination, the fundraiser stops</h2>
            <p>We're serious! There's only one nominee at a time, and we only raise money when they nominate the next player. If you break the chain by discontinuing the nomination, we won't raise any more funds!
                <br>
                That also means that <b>the slower you are to play, the less money we raise!</b></p>
                <p>&lt;company name&gt; is only donating from &lt;date 1&gt; to &lt;date 2&gt;, so the fewer nominations occur in that timeframe, the less money we make.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>Your participation will make or break the success of this fundraiser</h2>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>So what's the catch?</h2>
            <p>There is none. We're not going to sell any of the player's phone numbers or use them in any other way. We're just trying to find a fun way to raise money for a good cause.
                <br>
